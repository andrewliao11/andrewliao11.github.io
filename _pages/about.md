I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), supervised by [Prof. Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/index.html). 
I believe that the smarts of our machines are a mirror of our own thoughts, especially when we feed them with carefully curated and labeled datasets and interact with them in meaningful ways. Therefore, my reserach intersts lies in improving dataset labels both in precision and consistency and helping machine to be a better human feedback listener.


Previously, I worked at Vector Institute and USC as a visiting student in 2018 and 2017 respectively [blog]() [posts](). Before my Ph.D. journey, I studied Electrical Engineering in National Tsing Hua University, supervised by [Prof. Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io).
