I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), supervised by [Prof. Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/index.html). I was previously an intern at NVIDIA Toronto AI lab in 2022-2023 and Amazon Astros team in 2024. Prior to my Ph.D., I worked at Vector Institute and USC as a visiting student in 2018 and 2017 respectively [blog]() [posts](). Before my Ph.D. journey, I studied Electrical Engineering in National Tsing Hua University, supervised by [Prof. Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io).

Data is the keys to the modern machine learning and reflects the minds of the AI tools. I am fascinated with various ways to improve visual labels via machine learning My reserach intersts lies in improving dataset labels both in precision and consistency and helping machine to be a better human feedback listener.
