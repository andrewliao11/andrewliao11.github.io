:star: **I am on the job market for an industry role starting mid 2025. If my research aligns with your needs, please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:andrewliao11@gmail.com).**

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) and Vector Institute. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/index.html). 
Previously, I was an CV/ML scientist intern at NVIDIA Toronto AI lab in 2022 - 2023 and Amazon Astros team in 2024. 

I am interested in developing and analyzing large Vision-Language Models. Specifically, I focus on the application of building scalable & efficient data labeling pipeline. Check my papers in
- Improving human-annotated labels [[CVPR'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12690)] [[ICLR'24](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ChHx5ORqF0)]
- Improving machine-generated labels [[EMNLP'24](https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/2409.09788)] [[arXiv'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06510v1)]
